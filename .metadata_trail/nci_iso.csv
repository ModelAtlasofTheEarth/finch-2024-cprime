Dataset lineage information*,"This model simulates the development of C' shear bands in ductile shear zones. The model begins with an equigranular texture of three phases: a strong phase (e.g., feldspar) an intermediate-strength phase (e.g., quartz) and an anisotropic weak phase (e.g., mica). Dextral shearing stretches and rotates the microstructure, forming S-C fabric, asymmetric folds and C' shear bands."
